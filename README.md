# Password-Manager-PythonMySQL

## Description
In this project, I made a Password Manager with Python and MySQL Database. The project adopts CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE) concept. Before You can play with it, there is an authentification; You must enter a MySQL Database password so that you can access your program. There are 5 options there:
+	Create -> to create a new account and password
+	Read -> to show a list of account and its password
+	Update -> to change password of selected account
+	Delete -> to remove account and its password
+	Quit -> Stop the program

I just upload my python file here. So, you will create your own database according to the database image.
